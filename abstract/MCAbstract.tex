In recent experiments demonstrating Pauli blocking of light scattering from quantum degenerate Fermi gases, we made use of similarly prepared bosons as a benchmark \cite{Deb2021}. In contrast to the monotonic decrease of light scattering encountered for fermions entering the degenerate regime, bosons below the critical temperature $T_C$ for Bose-Einstein condensation display a peaked increase of light scattering \cite{Morice1995,Bons2016}. The enhancement which is tied to an increase in the imaginary part of the refractive index for a Bose gas around $T_C$, was observed in connection to the study \cite{Deb2021}, both as a reduction in transmitted probe light and as an increase in fluorescence as measured on an EMCCD camera. Here we extend our bosonic fluorescence measurements into the time domain, using a single photon counting module. We present recent results that provide a unique window into the dynamics of light scattering from a degenerate gas as it gradually heats up and become thermal.



%Understanding atom-light interactions has been critical to the
%development of modern quantum mechanics, and it remains an active area
%of research. The way ultracold indistinguishable particles scatter
%light has been theorised for a long time, though only recently have
%corresponding measurements made it to the literature, especially the
%suppression of scattering in a near-degenerate gas of Fermions. We
%instead report observations of the corresponding enhancement in light
%scattering off Bosons. This allows us to witness the ``boiling'' of a
%Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).
